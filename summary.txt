If I have more time and scope, I will consider below points on this task,

1/ I will use a simple PHP framework (mostly CodeIgniter) to implement this task.
2/ Will use some databases to process the data realtime.
3/ Will have some screens to perform CRUD operations on Movies, Actors and Roles.
4/ Will use some designs to list and show the details of the movies for a frontend user.
5/ Also can be consider more properties of the MOvie and Actor if permitted.
